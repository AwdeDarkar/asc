<p><em>“In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is
indispensable.”</em></p>
<p><em>-Dwight D. Eisenhower</em></p>
<p>There has been of late some interest in playing strategy games as a group within AWDE. However, since
this is AWDE, it will not do to simply play strategy games. At least one level of recursion is
required.</p>
<p>This document proposes a model for a tournament of strategy games where the winner or winners of each
game get points and at the end of the tournament whoever has the most points wins. Additionally,
games will include a prediction market which offer additional points for correct predictions.</p>
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Motivation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#motivation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We want to play strategy games and test out long-term strategies and other techniques, but with the
amount of experimentation likely, especially considering the prediction market aspect, it is crucial
to ensure the rules of the tournaments are as clear as possible.</p>
</div>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Epistemic Status</a><a class="headerlink" href="#epistemic-status" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I, Darkar, have spent quite a lot of time thinking about this tournament; at least three weeks of
consideration. I’ve consulted with others in AWDE to look for flaws (of which Greg found several)
and specifically considered adversarial positions. However, this system has yet to be tested and no
amount of thinking or preparation will be as informative as a single game. I expect significant
updates after the first tournament is run and this will probably coincide with the 1.0 version.</p>

<p>One of the core features of a tournament is its pool of games: before a tournament commences, this
pool must be created. For a game to be considered for the pool it</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Must be accessible and usable for all players; if the game costs money to play, each player must
own a copy. If the technical requirements are strenuous, each player’s computer must be able to
run it in a multiplayer setting without difficulty (as judged by the players themselves).</li>
<li>Must not have an expected duration longer than half the tournament’s planned length.</li>
<li>Should have either an in-game or explicitly defined house-ruled victory condition that allows for
more than one winner. Multipolar victories are an important part of the Strategy Games, so this
is a strong ‘should’.</li>
<li>Should have been tested explicitly in a ‘dry-run’ setting outside of the tournament’s competitive
pressure to prevent unexpected problems and ensure all players are familiar with the mechanics.</li>
<li>May be a pure or partial strategy game. The game does not even need to be explicitly a strategy
game if they players decide they want to include something else in their pool.</li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="scoring">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id9">Scoring</a><a class="headerlink" href="#scoring" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The number of points that can be earned by winning a single game is proportional to the number of
weeks that game is expected to run (decided before the game begins) rounded up. If more than one
player wins a game the points are split amongst the winners either evenly or according to a scoring
rule that each winner consents to (default to even split if no rule can be agreed upon).</p>
<p>If there is only a single winner then an additional single-victory bonus is added equal to 5% of the
total points that would otherwise be split among individual players.</p>
<p>The algorithm for calculating the number of points available per week is as follows:
POINTS = NUMBER_OF_PLAYERS * OPTIONS_PER_PLAYER * 120</p>
<p>Where the number of players is the number of players playing the game and the options per player is
the number of options for sale for each player on the prediction market.</p>
<p>There may be a need for tiebreakers and this is currently an unaddressed problem with this
specification.</p>

<div class="section" id="prediction-market">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Prediction Market</a><a class="headerlink" href="#prediction-market" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>One of the central features of the AWDE Strategy Tournament is the prediction market, which rewards
not only good play at the specific games in question but also good calibration about one’s own
abilities compared to others. The way the market works is as follows:</p>
<p>The market consists of <em>options</em> which have the name of a player on them and can be owned by any
player, regardless of the name they have. When a game is finished, the options with the names of
players that got a victory condition pay out 100 points to their owners.</p>
<p>Each tournament has an OPTIONS_PER_PLAYER value that determines the number of options that are
created at the start of a game for each player.</p>
<p>The intent of this is to have the value of the options as they are traded on an open market equal
the probability of that player’s eventual victory as best understood by every player at the time.</p>
<p>This allows winners to double down on their winnings if they are confident, allows losers to get
points for guessing well, and allows the uncertain to hedge their bets. The market operates in two
distinct phases: the pre-game <em>auction</em> and the game contemporary <em>market</em>.</p>
<div class="section" id="auction">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id11">Auction</a><a class="headerlink" href="#auction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Before a game begins, all of the options are created and auctioned off using a Vickery auction. If
the OPTIONS_PER_PLAYER is greater than one then the options are auctioned on a cycle (so the same
player’s options do not come up for auction more than once in a row). The average price each option
sold for when the auction is finished is listed publicly, but the owners are not.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="market">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Market</a><a class="headerlink" href="#market" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Once the game commences, the market begins. Every owner of an option will list the minimum price
they would sell that option for (defaults to 100) and every player will list the maximum they would
be willing to pay to purchase an option for each other player.</p>
<p>Every interval (decided on a per-game basis; maybe a turn, maybe a day) the following algorithm is
run:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">each</span> <span class="n">option</span> <span class="nb">type</span><span class="p">:</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can think of this algorithm as simply taking the two lists of prices, the buyers and the
sellers, and starting with the most extreme possible trades and moving in to maximize the trade
surplus of each exchange.</p>
<p>The last price at which an option was bought is listed in the market for public visibility.</p>
<p>In the future, it may be useful to include the ability to hold a ‘short’ position on an option (or,
similarly, having ‘negative’ options that pay out only if that player does <em>not</em> get a victory).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id13">Example</a><a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Consider a tournament with three players, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, and an OPTIONS_PER_PLAYER of 2.
At the start of a game, 6 options are created: 2 a-options, 2 b-options, and 2 c-options. An auction
is run to sell off these options to interested players.</p>
<p>First, an a-option is up for sale.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Alice bids 50, Bob bids 20, and Charlie bids 80.</li>
<li>The option is sold to Charlie for 50. Then, a b-option is sold in the same way, and a c-option.</li>
<li>After that, the auction loops back around to sell the second a-option, second b-option, and
second c-option.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>After the auction,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Alice owns 1 a-option and 1 c-option.</li>
<li>Bob owns 2 b-options.</li>
<li>Charlie owns 1 a-option and 1 c-option.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>However, none of them know what options the others own (unless they tell each other).</p>
<p>The game begins; it is a turn-based strategy game and every turn the market updates. Looking at the
a-option:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Alice, an a-option owner, will sell her option for at least 60 and buy another for at most 55.</li>
<li>Bob will buy an a-option for at most 30</li>
<li>Charlie will sell his a-option for at least 70 and buy another for at most 75</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>So the list of <em>sellers</em> is [60, 70] and the list of buyers is [30, 55, 75]</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The trade (60, 75) occurs; Alice sells her a-option to Charlie for 68.</li>
<li>70 &lt; 55 so no other a-option trades occur.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Now, Alice only owns a c-option and Charlie owns both a-options. If the game were to end at this
moment with Alice as the only winner, Charlie would get 200 points from his a-options and Alice
would get 756 points for her victory.</p>
