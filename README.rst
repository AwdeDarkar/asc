AWDE Standards Core
====================================================================================================

Standards are useful for eliminating confusion and providing clear points of reference for future
work. They also provide as useful tool for planning and optimization, especially when combined with
reflective tools like robust documentation.

This is a collection of public-facing protocols for use in AWDE, inspired by systems like the
foundational `Request For Comments <https://www.ietf.org/standards/rfcs/>`_ or the splendid
`Python Enhancement Proposals <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/>`_. The AWDE Standards Core (ASC,
pronounced like 'ask') is a collection of standards and protocols for use within the AWDE
organization. These ASCs are stored on github and they can be viewed on `Github Pages
<https://awdedarkar.github.io/asc/build/html/>`_
